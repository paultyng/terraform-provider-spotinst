## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `rollout_spec_name` - (Required) Identifier name for Ocean CD Rollout Spec. Must be unique
* `failure_policy` - (Optional) Holds information on how to react when failure happens.
    * `action` - (Required) Choose an action to perform on failure. Default is `abort`.  Enum: "abort" "pause" "promote".
* `spot_deployment` - (Optional) Represents the SpotDeployment selector.
    * `spot_deployment_cluster_id` - (Optional) Ocean CD cluster identifier for the references `SpotDeployment`.
    * `spot_deployment_name` - (Optional) The name of the `SpotDeployment` resource
    * `spot_deployment_namespace` - (Optional) The namespace which the `SpotDeployment` resource exists within.
* `spot_deployments` - (Optional) You must specify either `spotDeployment` OR `spotDeployments` but not both. Every SpotDeployment has to be unique. If more than one `SpotDeployment` has been configured, no `traffic` managers can be set as part of the RolloutSpec.For such case ensure that each of the chosen SpotDeployments are being exposed with different Kubernetes services.
    * `spot_deployments_cluster_id` - (Optional) Ocean CD cluster identifier for the references `SpotDeployment`.
    * `spot_deployments_name` - (Optional) The name of the `SpotDeployment` resource
    * `spot_deployments_namespace` - (Optional) The namespace which the `SpotDeployment` resource exists within.
* `strategy` - (Optional) Determines the Ocean CD strategy
    * `strategy_name` - (Required) Ocean CD strategy name identifier.
    * `args` - (Optional) Arguments defined in Verification Templates.
        * `arg_name` - (Required) Name of an argument.
        * `arg_value` - (Optional) Value of an argument.
        * `value_from` - (Optional) Defines from where to get the value of an argument.

                * `field_path` - (Required) Path to SpotDeployment's field from where to get the value of an argument.
* `traffic` - (Optional) Hosts all of the supported service meshes needed to enable more fine-grained traffic routing. In case `SpotDeployments` contains more than one SpotDeployment the `traffic` manager may not be configured.
    * `canary_service` - (Optional) The canary service name.
    * `stable_service` - (Optional) The stable service name.
    * `alb` - (Optional) Holds ALB Ingress specific configuration to route traffic.
        * `alb_annotation_prefix` - (Optional) Has to match the configured annotation prefix on the alb ingress controller.
        * `alb_ingress` - (Required) Refers to the name of an `Ingress` resource in the same namespace as the `SpotDeployment`.
        * `alb_root_service` - (Required) References the service in the ingress to the controller should add the action to.
        * `service_port` - (Required) Refers to the port that the Ingress action should route traffic to.
        * `stickiness_config` - (Optional) Allows to specify further settings on the ForwardConfig.
            * `duration_seconds` - (Optional) Defines how long the load balancer should consistently route the user's request to the same target.
            * `enabled` - (Optional) Enables the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific target.
    * `ambassador` - (Optional) Holds specific configuration to use Ambassador to route traffic.
      * `mappings` - (Required) A list of names of the Ambassador Mappings used to route traffic to the service.
    * `istio` - (Optional) Holds Istio specific configuration to route traffic.
        *  `destination_rule` - (Optional) It references to an Istio DestinationRule to modify and shape traffic. `DestinationRule` field belongs only to the Subset Level approach.
             * `destination_rule_name` - (Required) Holds the name of the DestinationRule.
             * `canary_subset_name` - (Required) The subset name to modify labels with the canary version.
             * `stable_subset_name` - (Required) The subset name to modify labels with the stable version.
       * `virtual_services` - (Required) Defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when a host is addressed.
           * `virtual_service_name` - (Required) Holds the name of the VirtualService.

               * `sni_hosts` - (Optional) A list of all the SNI Hosts of the TLS Route desired to be matched in the given Istio VirtualService.
    * `nginx` - (Optional) Holds Nginx Ingress specific configuration to route traffic.
      * `nginx_annotation_prefix` - (Optional) Has to match the configured annotation prefix on the Nginx ingress controller.
      * `stable_ingress` - (Required) Refers to the name of an `Ingress` resource in the same namespace as the `SpotDeployment`.
      * `additional_ingress_annotation` - (Optional) Provides additional features to add to the canary ingress (such as routing by header, cookie, etc). You can add these Kubernetes annotations to specific Ingress objects to customize their behavior. Above are found examples of accepted k8s keys.For the full list of supported keys, you may reach the following documentation - https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#canary.
          * `canary_by_header` - (Optional) Allows customizing the header value instead of using hardcoded values.
          * `key1` - (Optional) Any of supported annotations.
